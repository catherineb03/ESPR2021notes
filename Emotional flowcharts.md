# Emotional flowcharts
## Key ideas 
- Investigating the cause of your emotions or categorising your emotions in order to identify the appropriate response
- Series of splitting questions
- An example of a [[system]] you build when ↑willpower to use when ↓willpower

The physical artefact (i.e. the actual flowchart) and the time-consuming, abstracted process can help you 'step outside' of your emotion and choose your response. A kind of [[mindfulness]] practice?
