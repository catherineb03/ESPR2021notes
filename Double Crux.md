e.g. animals suffer -> morally impermissible to eat animals
animals do not suffer -> morally permissible to eat animals

The question of whether animals suffer or not is a double crux. 

You can have multiple cruxes, perhaps with one foundational crux.

**How to double crux**
- Paraphrase ("What I think you said was...")
- Operationalise ("What do you mean by X?")
- Pause and think

**Takeaways from practice**
- hard to identify your own cruxes
- hard to respond to their point, rather than related points
	- listening/paraphrasing helps
- focus on concepts or assumptions

	b(I could be wrong!)
	c(on the same side)
	f(truth-seeking)
	d(can use techniques solo)
	e(less effective)
	a --> b
	a --> c --> f
	a --> d --> e
