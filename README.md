* Philosophy of Therapy, Damon
* Fermi for Beginners, Yiwa and Jan
* Learning How to Learn, Neel
* Leadership, Raymond (I'd be intrigued by notes on this tbh)
* Prisoner's dilemma for algorithms, Mihály
* Statistical street fighting, Yiwa
* Owen Cotton-Barratt's talk
* Calibration training, Q and Neel
* Coordination problems, Stag
* Mathematication, Neel, Jan, and Mihály
* Davidad's talk
* Better conversations with yourself, Jan and Elizabeth
* Grand futures, Gavin and Mihály
