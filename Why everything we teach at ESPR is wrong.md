## Why everything we teach at ESPR is wrong 

My notes for this are pretty brief, here are the key ideas I jotted down.

- Try to dissassociate the subject from the presenter
	- People you respect can be wrong about stuff too
- Truthfulness $\not\equiv$ usefulness
- Map $\neq$ territory
	- But the map doesn't necessarily have to correspond to the territory to be useful

## Communicating concepts is hard

## Equal and opposite advice
Some people should probably be more X, some should be less X, saying "be more X" isn't true for everyone.

## Raymond's words of wisdom

The things you learn at ESPR work within the context of ESPR. They might not work in a different context - translating across domains is hard.

**Things you can try:**
- building a specific context you can try stuff in
- combine different ideas
- self-experimentation

## Things you can do after ESPR
- stay in touch
- track your motivation ([[What's Stopping You#What do you need | helps with success spirals]])
- form a [[Inner Simulator|plan]] for [[Systems and routines|future]] [[Goal Factoring|actions]]

## [[Lines of retreat]] for if rationality is wrong
this was Evie's question and it was a great question imo
- Actively [[Cracking cultural codes|seek out and engage with ]] other methods/belief systems/ways at getting to truth
- Read Karl Popper, David Deutsch
- Make non-rationality friends
- Rationality makes testable empirical claims - so go out and test them!
- Focus on rationality's instrumental value - what it does for you
