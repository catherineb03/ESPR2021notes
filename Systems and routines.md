# Systems and routines
## Key ideas
* Default actions are the ones we take when we're low on energy/willpower/care
* You can identify and change them by building better systems and routines
* Don't put energy where it's unhelpful - **wasted motion**
* Notice the energy required for actions you want to take and decrease it

## Examples

```mermaid
	flowchart LR
	a(routines)
	b(concrete commitments)
	c(algorithms)
	d(rules that hold generally)
	e(automation)
	f(micro systems)
	g(triage)
	a-->o(after X, I do Y)
	b-->h("I will X at 9AM every other day")
	c-->i(packing for travel)
	d-->j("If X, then Y")
	d-->n(saves resources considering every case)
	e-->k(wifi turns off after midnight)
	g-->l(e.g. moving tools you use close to hand)
	f-->m(cut the least important stuff)
```

## The process
```mermaid
	flowchart TD
	a(Identify the problem)
	b(Explore)
	subgraph  
	c(examples)
	d(do a mindful walkthrough)
	end
	e(Rough plan)
	f(use your inner simulator)
	g(Inner Simulator reality check and debugging)
	h(implementation)
	i(doing the thing)
	a==>b
	b==>e
	b-->c
	b-->d
	e==>g
	e-->f
	g-.->e
	g==>h
	h==>i
```

## How to identify problems
- bottlenecks 🍾
- things you need
- significant inefficiencies
- where you're spending willpower

All systems fail. The aim is to *predict* when systems will fail and *plan* to rebuild them. Try to **look upstream** and build a causal chain. What went wrong? Where is the lowest cost point to intervene in?

```mermaid
	flowchart TD
	A-->B
	B-->C
	C-->D
	D-->e[System failure]
	f[Even if D is where the system failed, it might be cheaper to change A, B, or C.]
	g[Desired outcome]
	D-.->g
```

A **mindful walkthrough** is like the [[Inner Simulator]], but for past events. Walk through where your system failed. How can you most easily fix it?

## What makes a good system?
- Effort ≈ 0
- Reliable

## How can you build reliable systems?
- make routines sacred
- minimise points of failure
- keep as simple as possible
	- automate
	- batch
- use friction to your advantage

**Examples:**
- Morning runners who sleep in their running clothes
- Automatically turning off your phone's wifi at the library
- Batching life admin to a specific hour once a week
- Putting healthy snacks on the counter and less healthy ones at the back of a cupboard
- To do list widget on phone screen

## On not expecting success
By default, all systems fail. Don't feel bad about it and don't expect to succeed.

Using a reverse [[Inner Simulator]] can help calibrate your expectations and minimise the pain of failure. Ask "would I be surprised if I succeeded on my first try?"
