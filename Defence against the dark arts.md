# Defence against the dark arts
## Key ideas
How to not be taken advantage of, or how to take advantage of people

## Techniques
**Framing** - time pressure, no perceived alternatives
**Anchoring** - what you offer influences the numbers other people go for, e.g. offering something for ¬£250 makes the other person more likely to consider offers around the ¬£250 mark
**Adverse selection**
People will make bets with you if they expect to win them. If bets are zero-sum, this means they think their bet will have a negative EV for you.
**Risk aversion**
**Replacibility** - e.g. the intern example, "I have hundreds of capable applicants waiting"
**Power dynamics** - who gets to frame the bet?
**Social pressure**
**Sense of obligation or duty**
**Building a rapport**
	- illusion of openness creates sense of being heard
	- false friendship, offering 'special' deals
	- exchanging favours (at low cost to you)
	- labelling concerns (even without actually addressing them) makes the other person feel understood
**Illusion of authority/domain knowledge**
**Friction** - minimise deal friction, maximise friction of alternatives

## Betting rules of thumb üëç
- Ask "why does the other person want to make this bet with me?"
- Think about possible asymmetry of information (Yiwa's walk bet)
- Challenge framing
