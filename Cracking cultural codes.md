# Cracking cultural codes
## Key ideas
You can understand most cultures if you try!

```mermaid
	flowchart TB
	a(Understanding)
	b(Liking)
	a <--> b
	a --> a
	b --> b
```
...to some extent

**Components of a culture**
1) Canon - Alluded to
2) Jargon - â†‘ efficiency, keeps out [[outgroup]]
3) Conventions, vocabulary, techniques
4) Material conditions - what is required to produce thing?
5) Originality, deviance, substyles, greatness

you can (should?) proceed through these in rough order

**Method for infiltrating a culture**
```mermaid
	flowchart TD
	a(Find a critic you trust)
	b(Where is the quality? What are its aims?)
	c(What are the material conditions?)
	e(What is sociologically remarkable about this culture?)
	d(can't see value?)
	f(When do you accept you can't like it?)
	g(2 weeks for each step)
	a-->b
	b-->c
	c-.->d
	d-->e
	d-->f
```
